                Hiking, music, and learning are just a few of my hobbies. From backpacking to software development, I always like being involved
                with planning and completing anything I am a part of. In high school, I made the switch to Linux for my main OS, and since then
                have gotten experience with Linux system administration though this.

                While learning about software development, I noticed an interest in the security of software. Half way through my
                degree in computer science, there was a change in the curriculum to include a security concentration. As I was
                already planning to take many of the classes involved, I quickly jumped on the opportunity to learn more about
                security. I have since been able to gain experience with penetration testing tools, such as Burp Suite, IDA Pro,
                ZAP, and more. I have also been able to gain experience with the OWASP Top 10, and have been able to learn about
                the different types of attacks that can be performed on a system.
