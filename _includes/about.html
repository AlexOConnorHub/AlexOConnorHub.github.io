                Hiking, music, and learning are just a few of my hobbies. From backpacking to software development, I always like being involved
                with planning and completing anything I am a part of. In high school, I made the switch to Linux for my main OS, and since then
                have gotten experience with Linux system administration though this. I have a keen interest in securing information systems and
                building secure systems.
